# Variables in python

>A Python variable is a symbolic name that is a reference or pointer to an object. Once an object is assigned to a ?>variable, you can refer to the object by that name. But the data itself is still contained within the object

Python has no command for declaring a variable
A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it

```python
x = 5
```

>Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.
>Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories.
